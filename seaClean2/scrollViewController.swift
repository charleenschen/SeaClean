        label.text = "SeaClean focuses on educating the younger generation on water pollution and how plastic waste impacts marine ecosystems, human health, and climate change.  \n\nPlastic debris thrown in our oceans suffocates millions if not all animals. Wildlife such as fish, whales, sharks mistake the plastic waste for prey. Soon after, animals die of starvation as their stomachs become filled with plastic. According to UNESCO, Over 1 million marine animals (including mammals, fish, sharks, turtles, and birds) are killed each year due to plastic debris in the ocean. Currently, it is estimated that there are 100 million tons of plastic in oceans around the world.\n\nNot only does plastic affect sea life, but our own human health. According to the UN, every year, approximately 297,000 children under five die from diseases linked to poor sanitation, poor hygiene, or unsafe drinking water. To add, dirty water causes the death of a human every 10 seconds. The plastic floating around in seas contaminates water and thus leads humans to lesser lives and faster deaths. Scientifically, carcinogenic, plastic materials, interfere with the body’s endocrine system, causing developmental, reproductive, neurological, and immune disorders in both humans and wildlife. To add, according to the UN Environmental Programme, plastic can release harmful chemicals into the surrounding soil, which can then seep into groundwater and also the ecosystem. This can cause a range of potentially harmful effects on the species that drink the water.\n\nFinally, plastic production contributes to climate change. Plastic perpetuates climate change as it increases CO2 emissions thus making our planet hotter. Plastic goods are non-biodegradable meaning they don’t decompose and if they do it takes a little more than half a millennium. As they break down, they release toxic chemicals into the environment and are more likely to be ingested by vulnerable marine wildlife.\n\nWith our app, we strive to shed light on the important topic of water pollution through educating the next generation."
